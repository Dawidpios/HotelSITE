Within walking distance of all attractions. Would recommend organising an airport collection with the hotel as the local taxi drivers will try to rip you off. Small hiccup as we had to change rooms for our last night but nice bottle of Georgian wine from the manager as a thank you",

We began to get to know the owners and the staff, all of whom are very friendly and warm. We decided to book rooms here on our return from a side trip and now feel more like family than guests at a hotel. The location in old town is perfect, the food in the restaurant is great and we have used them to book transport on several occasions. When we took our side trip, they willingly offered to keep our excess luggage until our return. Very pleased with all.",

The have nice wines, gin and tonic, and we also sampled a cheese board which was quite good. Staff were helpful and kind. I'd recommend the roof terrace for a quiet evening. There was also a live violinist",
